# Compaction Session Transition Implementation

## Summary

We have successfully implemented a solution to the compaction "dropping on the floor" problem. The conversation now seamlessly transitions to a new session with the compacted history when compaction occurs, providing immediate token usage benefits.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Compaction Module (`heare/developer/compacter.py`)

**Added `CompactionTransition` dataclass:**
```python
@dataclass
class CompactionTransition:
    """Information about transitioning to a new session after compaction."""
    
    original_session_id: str
    new_session_id: str
    compacted_messages: List[MessageParam]
    summary: CompactionSummary
```

**Added `compact_and_transition()` method:**
- Checks if compaction is needed
- Performs compaction if required
- Returns transition information for session management
- Returns `None` if no compaction is needed

### 2. Modified Agent Loop (`heare/developer/agent.py`)

**Added explicit compaction checking:**
- Compaction is now checked at the beginning of each agent loop iteration
- Only performed when conversation state is complete (no pending tool results)
- Runs when conversation has actual content (> 2 messages)

**Added transition handling:**
- `_apply_compaction_transition()` function applies the transition to the agent context
- Updates session IDs to maintain parent-child relationship
- Replaces chat history with compacted version
- Clears tool result buffer for clean state

**User notification:**
- Informs user when compaction occurs and provides new session ID
- Shows transition: "X messages → new session Y"

### 3. Updated Context Flushing (`heare/developer/context.py`)

**Removed automatic compaction from flush:**
- `flush()` no longer performs compaction as a side effect
- Compaction is now handled explicitly in the agent loop
- Maintains backward compatibility with the `compact` parameter

**Updated all flush calls:**
- All `agent_context.flush()` calls now use `compact=False`
- Prevents double compaction and ensures proper session transition

## How It Works

### Before (Problem)
1. Conversation grows large
2. `flush()` detects need for compaction
3. Compaction generates summary and new messages
4. **But conversation continues with original full history**
5. Compaction benefit is lost

### After (Solution)
1. Conversation grows large
2. Agent loop explicitly checks for compaction need
3. If needed, `compact_and_transition()` creates transition info
4. Agent context is updated with compacted history
5. **Conversation continues with compacted history**
6. User is notified of transition
7. Both original and new sessions are saved

## Benefits

1. **Immediate token savings**: Conversation continues with compacted history
2. **Seamless user experience**: No manual intervention required
3. **Session preservation**: Original full conversation is preserved
4. **Clear lineage**: Parent-child session relationship is maintained
5. **Backward compatibility**: Existing behavior is preserved when compaction is disabled

## Testing

Created `test_compaction_transition.py` to verify:
- Compaction detection works correctly
- Transition objects are created properly
- Session IDs are managed correctly
- Message counts are reduced as expected
- All assertions pass ✅

## Usage Example

When a conversation reaches the compaction threshold (85% of context window by default):

```
[System Message]
Conversation compacted: 45 messages → new session a1b2c3d4
```

The user can continue the conversation normally, and all subsequent requests will use the compacted history, saving tokens and API costs.

## Configuration

- Compaction can be disabled with `--disable-compaction` flag
- Threshold ratio can be configured in `ConversationCompacter` (default: 85%)
- Works with all supported models and their respective context windows

## Future Enhancements

1. **Resume compacted sessions**: Enhance session resume to work with compacted sessions
2. **Compaction history**: Track compaction events in session metadata
3. **Smart compaction**: Use different strategies based on conversation type
4. **User control**: Allow users to trigger manual compaction

This implementation successfully solves the original problem and provides a solid foundation for future conversation management features.
